# Python Assignment

In these challenges, a Python script is created for analysing the financial records and polling data. The analysis is then both printed to the terminal the terminal and export to a text file with the results.

## Technologies Used:
* Python
* OS
* CSV

## PyBank

* Create a Python script for analysing the financial records of the company. You will give a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. 

* The Python script will analyse the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* In addition, the final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.

## PyPoll
